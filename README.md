## GTD on github Idea

We can have folder and markdwon on git. Why not using it as a GTD system. I can do everything that Omnifocus can do.

## Concepts

Map the concepts in Omnifocus:

- Inbox: inbox.md
- Action: Action Name @__tag__ ( ref the [RTM](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/help/?ctx=basics.smartadd.howdoiuse) ) 
- Project: __prject__name__.md
- Folder: folder
- Context: tags.md / @__tag__
- Perspective: need automation by script
  - Projects
  - Contexts
  - Forecast
  - Flagged
  - Review
  - Completed
  - Changed

## Commands 

- `ido-input.sh`: Collect the input to inbox
